              Your website is hosted on advanced cloud infrastructure, meaning
              it's served from multiple locations worldwide. When someone visits
              your site, they connect to the server nearest to them – whether
              they're in London, Tokyo, or Sydney. This means faster loading
              times and a better experience for all your visitors.

            <p className={`mb-4 text-neutral-400/90`}>
              Instead of complex tiers, our hosting scales naturally with your
              website's needs. We start with generous resources that work for
              most businesses, and as your site grows, your hosting grows with
              it – no complicated decisions required. You'll never pay for
              resources you don't need, and we'll proactively let you know if we
              spot opportunities to optimize your site's performance.
