          <h3 className={`mt-4 text-2xl font-bold`}>Intellectual Property</h3>
          <p>
            The intellectual property in the materials contained in this website
            are owned by or licensed to RAVENCI and are protected by applicable
            copyright and trademark law. We grant our users permission to
            download one copy of the materials for personal, non-commercial
            transitory use.
          </p>
          <p>
            This constitutes the grant of a license, not a transfer of title.
            This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of
            these restrictions or the Terms of Service, and may be terminated by
            RAVENCI at any time.
          </p>

          <h3 className={`mt-4 text-2xl font-bold`}>Liability</h3>
          <p>
            Our website and the materials on our website are provided on an 'as
            is' basis. To the extent permitted by law, RAVENCI makes no
            warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates
            all other warranties including, without limitation, implied
            warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a
            particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property, or
            other violation of rights.
          </p>
          <p>
            In no event shall RAVENCI or its suppliers be liable for any
            consequential loss suffered or incurred by you or any third party
            arising from the use or inability to use this website or the
            materials on this website, even if RAVENCI or an authorized
            representative has been notified, orally or in writing, of the
            possibility of such damage.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the context of this agreement, &ldquo;consequential loss&rdquo;
            includes any consequential loss, indirect loss, real or anticipated
            loss of profit, loss of benefit, loss of revenue, loss of business,
            loss of goodwill, loss of opportunity, loss of savings, loss of
            reputation, loss of use and/or loss or corruption of data, whether
            under statute, contract, equity, tort (including negligence),
            indemnity, or otherwise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied
            warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or
            incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.
          </p>

          <h3 className={`mt-4 text-2xl font-bold`}>Severance</h3>
          <p>
